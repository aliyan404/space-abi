  Interaction with smart contracts on Starknet
<p>

A user-friendly tool for seamless interaction with smart contracts on Starknet. Inspired by [abi.ninjia](https://github.com/BuidlGuidl/abi.ninja). This project offers a quick and efficient way to call contract methods using addresses, streamlining the process for developers and users alike..

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aliyan404/space-abi.git

npm install --legacy-peer-deps

npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
